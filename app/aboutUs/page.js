It is especially important to brush your teeth right before going to bed. The toothbrush you use should be ADA approved with soft bristles. Electronic toothbrushes are also recommended because they are easy to use and effectively remove plaque.

                                <strong>1. At-Home Teeth Whitening:</strong> Most at-home teeth whitening systems come in a gel form that is put into a custom-fitted mouth guard (also known as a tray) that is molded to the shape of your teeth. The gel-filled trays can be worn overnight while you sleep or during the day. The amount of time the trays are required to remain in your mouth depends, although typically, trays are worn twice a day for around 30 minutes each session. This type of whitening procedure can take several weeks before you see results.

                            <Paragraph>
                                <strong>2. In-Office Teeth Whitening:</strong> Teeth whitening performed at a dental office may require more than one visit, each lasting anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes. You will instantly see results with this type of procedure. The bleaching solution used by the dentist is applied to your teeth, and your gums are completely protected. Some patients experience tooth sensitivity after having their teeth bleached in a dental office, but this typically wears off within a few days.

                                The Zoom whitening process uses a 25% hydrogen peroxide gel that is activated via a special UV light. You‚Äôll see results immediately after the procedure, including measurements of your new tooth shade vs. your original. Your teeth will lose moisture during the procedure and be dehydrated, but will regain their moisture over the next several days. This is why it‚Äôs recommended to wait about a week before proceeding with any further cosmetic dentistry work, such as crowns or veneers.
